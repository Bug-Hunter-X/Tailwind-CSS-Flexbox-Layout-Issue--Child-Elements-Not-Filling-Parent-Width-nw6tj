# Tailwind CSS Flexbox Layout Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS's flexbox utilities.  The problem arises when child elements within a flex container do not occupy the full available width, even when using fractional widths like `w-1/2`. This often happens when the parent container's width isn't explicitly defined.

## Bug Description
The `bug.js` file contains a simple example that illustrates the problem.  Two divs with `w-1/2` classes, inside a flex container, don't always fill the entire parent width.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file shows a corrected version. Adding a width to the parent container (e.g., `w-full`) resolves the issue, ensuring the child elements occupy the full width correctly.
